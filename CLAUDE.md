# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## üéØ Project Overview

**Zuno Marketplace**: Production-ready, modular NFT marketplace built with Foundry/Solidity ^0.8.30

It supports ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens with advanced trading features including auctions, offers, bundles, and comprehensive collection management.

**Tech Stack:**

- Foundry for smart contract development, testing, and deployment
- OpenZeppelin contracts for security and standards (Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, Initializable)
- OpenZeppelin Clones for minimal proxy pattern (gas-efficient deployments)
- Solidity ^0.8.30 with custom errors and type-safe operations
- Makefile for common tasks and shortcuts

**Note:** This is a pure Foundry project - use Foundry or Makefile commands for all operations.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical**: This is a security-critical smart contract project handling financial transactions and NFT transfers.

## üî¥ RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Methodology (MANDATORY)

**EVERY code change MUST follow this cycle:**

### 1. üî¥ RED: Write failing tests FIRST

- Write test cases that define the expected behavior
- Run tests to confirm they fail for the right reasons
- **Never skip this step, even for "simple" changes**

### 2. üü¢ GREEN: Write minimal code to pass ALL tests

- Implement the simplest solution that makes tests pass
- Focus on making it work, not making it perfect
- All tests must pass before moving to refactor

### 3. üîµ REFACTOR: Improve code while keeping ALL tests passing

- Optimize for readability, maintainability, and gas efficiency
- Apply design patterns and best practices
- Run tests continuously to ensure nothing breaks

### ‚õî FORBIDDEN

- Writing implementation before tests
- Skipping/removing tests to make code "work"
- Leaving any tests failing
- Committing code with failing tests
- Commenting out tests instead of fixing issues

## Architecture Overview

### Core Design Patterns

**1. Proxy Pattern for Gas Efficiency:**

- Collection factories use minimal proxy (clone) pattern via OpenZeppelin's `Clones.sol`
- Implementation contracts: `ERC721CollectionImplementation`, `ERC1155CollectionImplementation`, `EnglishAuctionImplementation`, `DutchAuctionImplementation`
- Factories deploy cheap clones that delegate to implementation contracts
- Reduces deployment gas costs significantly

**2. Initializer Pattern:**

- Base contracts like `BaseNFTExchange` use OpenZeppelin's `Initializable`
- Contracts have empty constructors and separate `initialize()` functions
- Enables proxy pattern compatibility and upgradeable designs

**3. Modular Architecture:**

- Core functionality split across specialized contracts (Exchange, Collection, Auction, Fees, Access)
- Libraries handle reusable logic (NFTTransferLib, PaymentDistributionLib, RoyaltyLib, etc.)
- Separate files for Events, Errors, Types/Structs
- **Registry + Hub Pattern** for frontend integration (see below)

**4. Dual Hub Pattern (Production-Grade Admin/User Separation):**

- **AdminHub** (`src/router/AdminHub.sol`): Admin-only functions for marketplace management
  - Contract registrations (exchanges, collections, auctions)
  - Emergency controls and system configuration
  - Role-based access control with OpenZeppelin AccessControl
  - Key Methods: `registerExchange()`, `registerCollectionFactory()`, `setAdditionalContracts()`
- **UserHub** (`src/router/UserHub.sol`): Read-only hub for frontend integration
  - Address discovery and query functions for users
  - No admin functions, only view/query operations
  - Key Methods: `getAllAddresses()`, `getExchangeFor()`, `verifyCollection()`
- **Registries** (`src/registry/`):
  - `ExchangeRegistry` - Maps TokenStandard enum to exchange addresses
  - `CollectionRegistry` - Maps collection types to factory addresses
  - `FeeRegistry` - Centralized fee calculations
  - `AuctionRegistry` - Maps AuctionType enum to implementation addresses
- **Philosophy**: Clear separation between admin operations and user queries
- **Benefits**: Enhanced security, better access control, production-ready architecture
- See `docs/user-guide.md` for complete integration guide

**5. Role-Based Access Control:**

- `MarketplaceAccessControl` manages admin, operator, and user permissions
- `EmergencyManager` provides pause/unpause functionality for critical scenarios
- `MarketplaceTimelock` enforces 48-hour delay on critical parameter changes to prevent rug pulls

### Dual Hub + Registry Architecture

**AdminHub (src/router/AdminHub.sol):**

- Admin-only functions for marketplace management
- OpenZeppelin AccessControl with ADMIN_ROLE
- Functions: `registerExchange()`, `registerCollectionFactory()`, `registerAuction()`, `setAdditionalContracts()`
- Emergency controls: `emergencyPause()`
- **Only accessible by designated admin addresses**

**UserHub (src/router/UserHub.sol):**

- Read-only hub for frontend integration
- No admin functions, only view/query operations
- Provides `getAllAddresses()` to get all contract addresses in one call
- Provides `getExchangeFor(nftContract)` to auto-detect ERC721 vs ERC1155
- Helper functions: `verifyCollection()`, `getSystemStatus()`, etc.
- **Does NOT wrap function calls** - only provides addresses and queries

**Registries (src/registry/):**

- `ExchangeRegistry` - Maps token standards to exchange contracts
- `CollectionRegistry` - Maps token types to factory contracts
- `FeeRegistry` - Unified fee calculations across platform
- `AuctionRegistry` - Maps auction types to auction contracts

**Frontend Flow:**

1. Initialize with UserHub address only
2. Call `userHub.getAllAddresses()` to get all contract addresses
3. Create contract instances for each address
4. Call contracts directly (not through hub)

**Admin Flow:**

1. Initialize with AdminHub address (admin wallet only)
2. Use AdminHub for all system configuration and emergency controls
3. Registrations and admin functions are protected by AccessControl

See `docs/user-guide.md` for complete documentation.

### Dual Hub + Registry Quick Start

**For Frontend/Users:**
1. Frontend needs only the `UserHub` address
2. Call `userHub.getAllAddresses()` once and cache returned contract addresses
3. Auto-detect exchange via `userHub.getExchangeFor(nftContract)` and call the exchange directly
4. Use UserHub helpers for queries only: `verifyCollection(...)`, `getSystemStatus(...)`

**For Admin Operations:**
1. Admin needs the `AdminHub` address and proper admin role
2. Use AdminHub for all system configuration: registrations, emergency controls
3. All admin functions are protected by OpenZeppelin AccessControl

#### Add a new token standard or module

- Extend the relevant enum/interface in the registry
- Deploy the new contract (e.g., exchange/auction)
- Register its address in the corresponding registry (admin-only)
- Frontend remains unchanged; Hub queries reflect the new registration

### Key Contract Relationships

**Exchange Layer:**

## Important Patterns and Conventions

### Fee System

- Taker fee: 2% (200 basis points) - configurable via `s_takerFee`
- Basis points denominator: 10000 (BPS_DENOMINATOR)
- Royalty support via EIP-2981
- Fee distribution handled by `PaymentDistributionLib`

### Listing IDs

Listings use deterministic `bytes32` IDs generated from:

```solidity
keccak256(abi.encodePacked(contractAddress, tokenId, seller, block.timestamp))
```

### Security Considerations

- All state-changing functions use ReentrancyGuard
- Input validation via dedicated validator contracts
- Timelock protection for critical parameter changes (48 hours)
- Emergency pause functionality for critical scenarios
- Pull payment pattern for fund withdrawals
- Comprehensive ownership and approval checks before NFT transfers

### Gas Optimization

- Use minimal proxy pattern for collection/auction deployment
- Libraries for code reuse instead of inheritance where appropriate
- Custom errors instead of string reverts
- Efficient storage patterns and packing

### Initialization vs. Constructors

When working with proxy-compatible contracts:

- Constructors should be minimal or empty
- Use `initialize()` functions with `initializer` modifier
- Call parent initializers using `__ParentContract_init()` pattern

## Foundry.toml

Don't use `via_ir = true`

## Environment Variables

Create `.env` for deployment (not tracked in git):

```bash
MARKETPLACE_WALLET=0x...  # Admin address
PRIVATE_KEY=0x...          # Deployer private key
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://...
MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://...
```

That's it! No other addresses needed. DeployAll.s.sol deploys everything.

## Deployment Scripts

Located in `script/deploy/`:

- **`DeployAll.s.sol`** - Deploy EVERYTHING (core + hub) in one command

Usage:

```bash
forge script script/deploy/DeployAll.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --verify
```

Output:

- All core contracts deployed
- AdminHub and UserHub deployed and configured
- **Frontend needs UserHub address, Admin operations use AdminHub address** (shown at end of deployment)

## Commit Convention

Project uses Conventional Commits:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, contract, deploy, security
Scopes: exchange, collection, auction, fees, security, factory, libraries, validation, access
```

**Examples:**

- `feat(exchange): add bundle trading support`
- `fix(auction): prevent bid overflow in dutch auction`
- `security(exchange): add reentrancy guard to purchase`

## Security Alert Protocol

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** commit the fix to a public branch
2. Document the issue privately
3. Propose fix with comprehensive tests
4. Tag with `security` type in commit message
5. Recommend immediate audit review

## Key Security Features

1. **Timelock Protection:** `MarketplaceTimelock` enforces 48-hour delay on critical operations
2. **Emergency Controls:** Pause/unpause via `EmergencyManager`
3. **Access Control:** Role-based permissions for admin operations
4. **Reentrancy Guards:** All critical functions protected
5. **Input Validation:** Dedicated validator contracts prevent invalid states
6. **Safe Transfers:** NFTTransferLib handles all NFT movements
